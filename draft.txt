# =>What is a process?
&> A process is an instance of a computer program that is being executed by a computer system. It is a fundamental concept in operating systems and represents the execution of a set of instructions within a computer's memory. Each process has its own memory space, resources, and execution state, which includes the program counter indicating the next instruction to be executed. Processes can run concurrently, meaning multiple processes can be executed simultaneously by the operating system, which allocates resources and manages their execution.
